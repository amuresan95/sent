This is a version of `sent` that I patched to include a [progress bar](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/patches/progress-bar/) and [better image scaling](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/patches/bilinear_scaling/) (all credit goes to the patches' respective authors). Read the code, read the docs, and `sudo make clean install` to compile your changes.


sent is developed at http://tools.suckless.org/sent
